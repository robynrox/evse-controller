# evse-controller

This is a system whose purpose is to control "smart" EVSEs such as the Wallbox Quasar. I have referred to
the source code of the [v2g-liberty](https://github.com/SeitaBV/v2g-liberty/) project to create it, but none of the code
is shared; this is intended to be simpler and more of a standalone project. In particular, this project is not intended
to use Home Assistant; if your needs include using Home Assistant then the above project may well be more suited to your
needs.

I have completed some library routines declaring the interfaces used for controlling EVSEs and reading from power
monitors and I have implemented these for the following devices:

* [Wallbox Quasar](https://wallbox.com/en_ca/quasar-dc-charger) for EV charging and discharging (V2G)
* [Shelly EM](https://shellystore.co.uk/product/shelly-em/) for energy monitoring enabling solar energy capture (like S2V)
  and load following (like V2H); here it is assumed that grid power is monitored through channel 0 and EVSE power through
  channel 1. The EVSE channel is only used for monitoring and reporting and could be substituted with the solar power, for
  example.

There's also a complete project that uses those libraries to provide V2X
functions along with logging, scheduled events, and web or console control
and its installation and basic use are detailed below.

This code may look more Javaesque than Pythonesque - I have more expertise in Java but I've chosen Python so that I can
learn a little bit more.

This uses code from a library that can use a Web API to control the Wallbox Quasar, but that code is only used to
restart the wallbox in the case of modbus failure, a condition that happens once every few days to myself. The library
used for this can be found here:

* https://github.com/cliviu74/wallbox

This has been tested and seems to work well.

I have also added logging to InfluxDB OSS version 2. This is the open-source variant and is documented here:

* https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/
* https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/install/?t=Linux for installation instructions if using Linux (also go to
  that page for other operating systems as the instructions are also there).

I do not believe it will work with version 1. If you just try `apt install influxdb`, it is likely that you will get
version 1, so I would suggest installing as per the official instructions on the page above.

## Data Storage

All variable data (configuration, logs, and state) is stored in a `data` directory. The default location is within the project root, including:
- `data/config/` - Configuration files including `config.yaml`
- `data/logs/` - Log files
- `data/state/` - State files including schedule and EVSE state

You can override the data directory location by setting the `EVSE_DATA_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export EVSE_DATA_DIR=/path/to/custom/data
python -m evse_controller.app

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:EVSE_DATA_DIR = "C:\path\to\custom\data"
python -m evse_controller.app
```

For container-based deployments, see [CONTAINER_GUIDE.md](CONTAINER_GUIDE.md).

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.7 or 3.12.3
- An EVSE device (currently supports Wallbox Quasar)
- A power monitor (currently supports Shelly EM)
- Optional: InfluxDB OSS v2 for logging
- Optional: poetry (an alternative installation method to pip)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository (or download it)**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robynrox/evse-controller.git
   cd evse-controller
   ```

   Alternatively download the ZIP file from GitHub by navigating to
   https://github.com/robynrox/evse-controller, clicking the Code dropdown and selecting Download ZIP. Then unpack it.

2. **Choose Setup Method**

   A. Using Dev Container (Experimental):
   - Install Docker and VS Code with Dev Containers extension
   - Open project in VS Code
   - Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   - Container will automatically install dependencies
   
   Note: Container support is currently experimental and hasn't been thoroughly tested. 
   For production use, I recommend using either the pip or Poetry installation methods.

   B. Using pip:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project directory
   cd path/to/evse-controller
   
   # Create virtual environment in a .venv subdirectory
   python3 -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Linux/macOS:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .\.venv\Activate.ps1
   
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e .
   ```

   C. Using Poetry (Alternative):
   ```bash
   # Install Poetry if you haven't already
   # On Linux/macOS/WSL:
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -

   # Navigate to project directory
   cd path/to/evse-controller

   # Install dependencies using Poetry
   poetry install

   # Install development dependencies (includes pytest for testing)
   poetry install --with dev

   # Activate the virtual environment
   poetry shell

   # Run unit tests as desired
   pytest
   ```

   Note: The virtual environment will be created in your project directory, regardless of which installation method you choose. You can clone or download this repository to any location on your system.

3. **Configuration**

  Before configuring, you may want to use the discovery tool to find your devices.
  See `evse-discovery/README.md` for detailed information about the discovery process.

  There are two ways to configure the application:

  A. Interactive Configuration:
  ```bash
  python configure.py
  ```
  This will guide you through setting up:
  - Wallbox connection details
  - Shelly EM configuration
  - InfluxDB settings (optional)
  - Charging preferences

  B. Manual Configuration:
  - Edit `config.yaml` directly (created by configure.py)
  - Configuration structure:
    ```yaml
    wallbox:
      url: "WB012345.ultrahub"  # Hostname or IP address
      username: "myemail@address.com"  # Optional, for auto-restart
      password: "yourpassword"         # Optional, for auto-restart
      serial: 12345                    # Optional, for auto-restart
    shelly:
      primary_url: "shellyem-123456ABCDEF.ultrahub"  # Hostname or IP address
      secondary_url: null              # Optional second Shelly
      grid:
        device: "primary"             # primary or secondary
        channel: 1                    # 1 or 2
      evse:
        device: ""                    # primary or secondary, empty if not used
        channel: null                 # 1 or 2, null if not used
    influxdb:
      enabled: false
      url: "http://localhost:8086"
      token: ""
      org: ""
    logging:
      file_level: "DEBUG"
      console_level: "WARNING"
      directory: "log"
      file_prefix: "evse"
      max_bytes: 10485760             # 10MB
      backup_count: 30
    charging:
      max_charge_percent: 90          # Maximum battery charge percentage
      solar_period_max_charge: 80     # Maximum charge during solar generation periods
      default_tariff: "COSY"          # COSY, OCTGO or FLUX
    ```

  Note: The old `configuration.py`/`secret.py` method has been removed. You should remove any existing `configuration.py` and `secret.py` files.

4. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   python -m evse_controller.app
   ```
   Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000

   Alternatively, for a headless version without web interface or REST APIs:
   ```bash
   python -m evse_controller.smart_evse_controller
   ```

### Configuration Options

Detailed explanation of each configuration option:

#### Wallbox Section
- `url`: IP address or hostname of your Wallbox Quasar
- `username`: Your Wallbox account email (optional, for auto-restart feature)
- `password`: Your Wallbox account password (optional, for auto-restart feature)
- `serial`: Your Wallbox serial number (optional, for auto-restart feature)
- `max_charge_current`: Maximum charging current, integer between 3-32 (amperes)
- `max_discharge_current`: Maximum discharging current, integer between 3-32 (amperes)

#### Shelly Section
- `primary_url`: IP address or hostname of your primary Shelly EM
- `secondary_url`: IP address or hostname of your second Shelly EM (optional)

#### InfluxDB Section
- `enabled`: Whether to enable InfluxDB logging (true/false)
- `url`: URL of your InfluxDB instance (default: http://localhost:8086)
- `token`: Authentication token for InfluxDB
- `org`: Organization name for InfluxDB

#### Charging Section
- `max_charge_percent`: Maximum battery charge percentage (0-100)
- `solar_period_max_charge`: Maximum charge during solar generation periods (0-100)
- `default_tariff`: Default electricity tariff (COSY, OCTGO, or FLUX)

#### Logging Section
- `file_level`: Logging level for file output (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- `console_level`: Logging level for console output (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- `directory`: Directory for log files
- `file_prefix`: Prefix for log filenames
- `max_bytes`: Maximum size of each log file in bytes (default: 10MB)
- `backup_count`: Number of backup log files to keep

Note: The configuration file is automatically generated by running 
`configure.py`, which provides an interactive setup process. You can also
edit the `config.yaml` file directly if you prefer.

## Data Backup

### InfluxDB Data Export
The `export_influxdb.py` script creates daily exports of your InfluxDB data in both CSV and JSON formats, automatically compressed using gzip for efficient storage.

Usage:
```bash
# Export a specific date
python src/evse_controller/tools/export_influxdb.py 2024-01-15

# Export a date range
python src/evse_controller/tools/export_influxdb.py 2024-01-01 2024-01-31

# Export yesterday's data (default behavior)
python src/evse_controller/tools/export_influxdb.py
```

Exports are saved to `data/backup/influxdb/` as gzip-compressed files:
- `powerlog_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz`: CSV format (gzipped)
- `powerlog_YYYYMMDD.json.gz`: JSON format (gzipped)

The compressed files can be read directly by pandas or decompressed using standard tools like `gunzip` or `zcat`.

### Automated Daily Backups
To automatically export each day's data, add this to your crontab:

```bash
# Edit your crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run at 1:00 AM daily
0 1 * * * cd /path/to/evse-controller && .venv/bin/python src/evse_controller/tools/export_influxdb.py
```

The script is idempotent - it only exports dates that haven't been backed up yet, making it safe to run multiple times.

## API Documentation

The system provides a REST API that can be explored and tested using the built-in Swagger UI:

1. Start the application using `python -m evse_controller.app`
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/docs`
3. The Swagger UI provides:
   - Interactive documentation for all API endpoints
   - The ability to test API calls directly from your browser
   - Detailed request/response models
   - Example values and expected responses

Key API features include:
- Control operations (charge, discharge, pause)
- Status monitoring
- Schedule management
- Configuration

### Development Environment Notes

If using VS Code (recommended):
1. The Dev Container configuration will automatically set up the correct environment
2. If developing outside the Dev Container, you'll need to select the correct Python interpreter:
   - Open Command Palette (View > Command Palette, or `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Choose the interpreter from your virtual environment (in the project's `.venv` directory)

## Limitations

- Currently only supports Wallbox Quasar for EVSE and Shelly EM for power monitoring. Other devices would require new interface implementations.
- The scheduling system supports Octopus Go, Cosy Octopus, and Octopus Flux tariff patterns. Agile tariff support is not implemented. Tariffs from other suppliers are also not implemented. There is an interface allowing for reasonably straightforward implementation of additional tariff support.
- The Wallbox occasionally requires automatic restarts due to Modbus communication issues, causing approximately 6 minutes of downtime when this occurs. Manual power cycling might be needed 3-4 times per year.
- The web interface is designed for local network use and doesn't include authentication or security features for remote access.
- The web interface currently has limited accessibility features. Users requiring screen readers or keyboard-only navigation may experience difficulties. If you need accessibility features, please open an issue on GitHub to discuss your requirements.

## Roadmap

* Creation of abstract APIs to control EV charging and discharging and to use current-monitoring CT clamps other than
  the Shelly (the APIs are complete)
* Add a user interface allowing for rapid termination of any current EV charging or discharging session (HTML seems to
  be the obvious way to go - this is now in progress and a working prototype is available)
* Add V2G and S2V capabilities that may be independently specified during a scheduled slot (this capability is now part
  of the library routines and is being added to the user interface)
* Add scheduling functionality based on a user-selected desired schedule including percentage-of-charge targets
  (basic scheduling is now available)
* I'm trying to attach greater importance to bug-fixing; it's more important for it to be solid than look pretty.

The above is an ideal and some of it is sure to be done out of order!

## Explanatory video

I have produced a video that explains my setup, how I use the system, and goes into some detail regarding the flux.py
scheduler. Note that it is long at 66 minutes! It is somewhat outdated now, but most of it still applies. You can find
that here:

## Shelly EM Housing

For safety reasons, the Shelly EM devices must be properly enclosed, especially since they monitor mains voltage. The repository includes OpenSCAD files for a 3D-printable housing solution in the `shelly-housing` directory:

- `shelly-housing-top.scad`: Creates a solid top piece for safety
- `shelly-housing-bottom.scad`: Creates a bottom piece with access holes for LEDs and buttons
- Pre-generated STL files are provided for immediate printing
- No guarantees as to suitability are provided - use at your own risk

### Assembly Notes
- The two halves need to be secured together with screws (specific hardware requirements TBD)
- Orient the bottom piece (with holes) facing away from potential sources of conductive materials
- Ensure all cables are properly strain-relieved

### Alternative Enclosure Options
If you don't have access to a 3D printer, you MUST still properly enclose the Shelly EM devices. Alternatives include:
- Using a sealed electrical junction box with appropriate cable glands
- Using any suitable enclosure rated for electrical equipment
- Professional installation in a proper electrical enclosure

⚠️ **SAFETY WARNING**: Operating Shelly EM devices without proper enclosure is:
- Dangerous due to exposed mains voltage connections
- Likely illegal in most jurisdictions
- A potential fire hazard
- NOT supported by this project

Always follow local electrical codes and safety regulations when installing power monitoring equipment.
